# Smart Expense System

A premium, feature-rich client-side personal finance manager and smart expense tracking platform. Built with a stunning dark-mode glassmorphic user interface, ambient glow animations, and interactive financial widgets.

This application provides a highly secure and private way to manage your personal finances. While user authentication and accounts are verified securely through a lightweight JWT backend, all sensitive financial records, budgets, and investments are kept **100% private**—stored client-side in the user's browser using `localStorage`.

## 🎨 Visual Design & Themes

The application features a modern, ultra-premium developer-centric dashboard designed to wow at first sight:
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Frosted glass-panel containers with custom blur effects (`backdrop-filter`) and thin, elegant borders.
- **Harmonious Color Palettes**: Clean dark-mode background defaults accented by vibrant, tailwind-curated tones.
- **Dynamic Accent Themes**: Switch between 4 premium themes in real-time under settings:
  - **Midnight (Default)**: Deep blue/violet space-age dashboard.
  - **Sunset**: Rich magenta, warm purple, and dark orange tones.
  - **Emerald**: Clean, refreshing deep forest-green and mint gradients.
  - **Nordic**: Sleek icy blue and slate-grey tones.
- **Ambient Micro-Animations**: Smooth floating transitions, animated background gradient shifting (`gradientShift`), and pulse-glow indicators for budgets and limits.
- **Interactive Component States**: Smooth scaling, shadow highlights, and instant interactive feedback (e.g. contribution heatmap scaling on hover).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
- `npm` (packaged with Node.js)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install all dependencies for both the frontend and backend using the root helper script:

```bash
# Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
npm run install:all
```

### Running the Application

You can start both servers concurrently with a single command from the root folder:

```bash
# Starts Node backend on http://localhost:5001 & Vite frontend on http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run dev
```

*The frontend proxy is preconfigured to route any requests directed at `/api/*` directly to the backend server at port `5001`.*

## 🔒 Privacy Notice
Your financial privacy is our priority. Since all transactional and ledger records are stored locally in your browser's `localStorage` storage container, **no financial data is ever sent to or saved on the backend server**. The backend database solely handles encrypted user authentication login sessions.
